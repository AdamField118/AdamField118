## Hi there 👋

My name is Adam Field, and I'm an undergraduate at WPI studying physics. I aspire to be an astrophysics researcher. I currently work on [ShearNet](https://github.com/s-Sayan/ShearNet).

## Projects

I really enjoy physics and coding! I do a lot of projects to try and unite the two.  
Some of my projects are:

- My [personal website](www.adamfield.org) where I house a blog and a dynamic resume coded in Three.js.
- A [physics simulations website](sims.adamfield.org) where I code physics simulations using webGL.
- [Modeling a Chaotic Pendulum](https://github.com/AdamField118/Chaotic_Pendulum) where I made a simulation of a double pendulum, software to track LEDs on a real double pundulum, then compared the two results.

## Personal

I work as a Peer Learning Assistant (undergraduate TA) for the WPI Physics Department. I enjoy supporting students through introductory physics classes. I attend studio style lectures, hold office hours, and grade!

I play soccer, run, and code for fun
