## Hi!

My name is Adam Field, and I'm an undergraduate at WPI studying physics. I aspire to be an astrophysics researcher. I currently work on [ShearNet](https://github.com/s-Sayan/ShearNet).

## Research

I focus on computational physics in my research, with a heavy emphasis on computational cosmology.

- I'm actively writing a research paper with my advisor [Sayan Saha](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/sayan-saha/) on [ShearNet](https://github.com/s-Sayan/ShearNet), a neural network based galaxy shear estimator written in JAX/Flax. This project has taught me a lot about not only deep learning techniques in physics, but also statistics and quantifying estimator bias.

- Previously I also worked with a researcher here at our HPC cluster, [Dr. Jackson Henry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackson-henry-b1a49410a/), on computational thermodynamics. We were focusing on repoducing results from the paper here [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13160](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13160) and extending their work to zero-sum games. We were trying to understand alternative characteristics of entropy on the one-dimensional network topologies. My main contributions was gpu-accelerated code for real time system evolution.

## Projects

I really enjoy physics and coding! I do a lot of projects to try and unite the two.  
Some of my projects are:

- My [personal website](http://www.adamfield.org) where I house a blog and a dynamic resume coded in Three.js.
- A [physics simulations website](http://portfolio.adamfield.org) where I code physics simulations using webGL.
- A website for my [computational physics independent study](http://comphys.adamfield.org) where I code FEM and FVM pipelines in python!
- [Modeling a Chaotic Pendulum](https://github.com/AdamField118/Chaotic_Pendulum) where I made a simulation of a double pendulum, software to track LEDs on a real double pundulum, then compared the two results.

## Personal

I work as a Peer Learning Assistant (undergraduate TA) for the WPI Physics Department where I enjoy supporting students through introductory physics classes. I attend studio style lectures, hold office hours, and grade! Recently I have even been running lectures, I like to focus on using open-source physics simulations to let students guide themselves to an understanding. See [physlets](https://www.compadre.org/Physlets/)!

I play soccer, run, and code for fun. I really love backpacking and playing ultimate frisbee.
